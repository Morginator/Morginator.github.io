  <h1> Welcome! </h1>
  <p>At this website I, Merel, will show u some AMAZING products from the IKEA! Some products are more amazing,
    and more useful than u would think!
</p>
  <p>  I will tell you something about the prizes from the products, their names  how cool they are and how useful they are!
</p>

<p> Fixes on our website </p>

<p> <li>  All of the prizes have the Dutch prizes, we are trying to get this fixed to all countries that have IKEA. </li>
     <li>Al off the names are Dutch, we are trying to get them as soon as possible in English and other languages. </li>
